Description	
The MBT-LA2 provides a comprehensive means of testing the state of charge and battery condition for 
2-volt, 4-volt, 6-volt, 8-volt, and 12-volt lead acid battery types (SLA, AGM, Gel, Wet).  Lightweight, compact 
design make it an ideal tool for anyone working with lead acid batteries.  This microprocessor-controlled in-
strument tests popular batteries using a patented, high accuracy pulse load test.  After a fully automatic test 
cycle, percentage of remaining battery capacity is indicated on the LED bar display.  Test results are easy to 
understand.  An integrated cooling fan dissipates heat from testing, and the circuit is protected against over-
voltage.  Rugged NBR rubber sleeve protects against impact.  Includes 48” removeable test leads with solid 
copper clamps.  The accessory kit (K-MBTLA2) includes a hanging strap & magnet for hands-free operation, 
and a protective soft case.  Requires 4AA batteries (not included).
